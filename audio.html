				        <p>So it’s April 14, 6:34 a.m., and we’re at UCLA Wilson Plaza and we’re just waiting to board the bus. Probably gonna be getting on in about 25 minutes. I took one last shower this morning, just to savor it before four days of no washing. <span class="verb">[LAUGHS]</span> Which is why baby wipes are gonna be the best. We’re just, we’re waiting.</p>

				        <p>I was so excited I actually couldn’t get a whole lot of sleep last night. <span class="paren">(<b>Cadet Garcia</b>: Hi, Cadet McDermott.)</span> Hi, Garcia. This is my buddy Garcia. He’s in my squad. <span class="paren">(<b>Cadet Garcia</b>: I’m not in his squad.)</span> Yes you are! <span class="verb">[LAUGHS]</span></p>

				        <p>Once we get on the bus I’ll probably enter my next log, once we start unpacking and whatnot. So yep, first log. <span class="verb">[WHISPERS]</span> Go Bruins.</p>

				        <p id="linebreak">***</p>

				        <p>Testing, testing. Okay so it’s April 14, Thursday, it’s 12:37. We just finished up some training at the Battle of Fallujah Training Course. It was pretty cool actually. I had a pretty interesting time. My squad and I did pretty well at all four of the stations we were at. I feel like that this is a good start to another four days worth of training.</p>

				        <p>We’re right now on a lunch break and I had my first MRE, which was really good actually, surprisingly. I heard a lot of bad things about the one that I had but it tasted pretty good. I’m feeling pretty good, I’m feeling ready for what’s coming up next.</p>

				        <p id="linebreak">***</p>

				        <p>I’m continuing off my last entry, it’s April 14, 4:24. We’ve moved away from the LRC and we are now at a location closer to the mock village that we will be revisiting in the coming days. We have just gone over rifle training, how to carry a rifle, use a rifle, shoot a rifle, the various type of information. We’ve also gone over EPW, which is enemy prisoner of war, and aid and litter.</p>

				        <p>Feeling a little hungry. <span class="verb">[LAUGHS]</span> But we’re about to have a really good meal. Right now being prepared. After this we’re gonna be rucking to our next location where we’re gonna be setting up a patrol base. I’m feeling good, I’m keeping hydrated and glad to be out here. Until then I will put in this as my third log.</p>

				        <p>I have the sniffles. This is log entry number four. Today is Friday, April 15, it’s 5:10. Woke up about 10 minutes ago after getting I think roughly four to five hours of sleep last night. So I’m feeling a little tired, not gonna lie. I also pulled security last night for two-and-a-half hours along with an additional two hours beforehand when we were forming the perimeter.</p>

				        <p>I’m feeling a little tired and a little hungry. But I got a couple snacks so I’ll be munching on that. I’m really missing my bed right now, like bigtime. I’m not gonna lie that that sleeping bag was not very comfortable and we slept on a hill, which sucked. <span class="verb">[LAUGHS]</span> But nonetheless I’m still having a good time, it’s a good experience and I’m really up for more. So until then, goodbye.</p>

				        <p id="linebreak">***</p>

				        <p>Today is April, Friday the fifteenth, it’s 12:45. We’ve just conducted, or we finished conducting a mission where we interrupted a SAAPA resupplying route. That was a pretty cool experience, we got to fire off our rifles at the enemy.</p>

				        <p>After conducting the mission and accomplishing the mission, we have come to a new patrol base. To the west of the village that we will be reconning today. We’ll be stepping off at around 2:30 and returning back at 4:30, which is when I’ll probably do my next entry.</p>

				        <p>Today is really, really hot and I think I already I have a sunburn on my neck. Definitely missing the A/C in my dorm and my bed and a shower. But hopefully the next couple days go smoothly, just as they’ve already been coming along.</p>

						<h2 id="title">17 APR 2016</h2>

		        		<p>Today is April 17, Sunday, it’s 7:30 and we’re all gathering up to prepare departure from the LDX location. My thoughts on the other night, the reason I couldn’t put a whole lot of entries is back to back to back we were on the field doing mission after mission after mission. I think yesterday was definitely a good experience as I was involved with all the missions that we conducted. On top of it, when we came back we did weapons maintenance and cleaning which unfortunately took a very long time. It looks like we’re getting ready to do a police call. This is my last entry. I had a really great experience.</p>

		        <p id="refer">ROTC cadets from schools across Southern California, including UCLA, completed a four-day Leadership Development Exercise at the Marine Corps Base in Camp Pendleton earlier this April. Apart from being assessed on how well they executed military tactics and displayed physical endurance, the Bruin Battalion was also evaluated on how well they utilized their interpersonal skills and showed empathy as leaders. These future members of the United States Army are actively being taught to wield diplomacy with the same skill as an assault rifle.</p>

After you’ve been into a soldier’s shoes, or a police officer’s shoes, or a fireman’s shoes, and you’re also an everyday person. You have that ability to grasp with all the knowledge you have and be like okay, this needs to be changed because this isn’t fair to our soldiers, this isn’t fair to our citizens, the shouldn’t be doing this. On the political level, you can make that happen.</p>

I hope that these steps, as we go along, just do a better job to bring that sort of leader, who is adaptable, who is capable of relating to such a diverse world that is ever evolving.</p>
