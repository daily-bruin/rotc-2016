        <p>A slide depicting a map of an arid desert region illuminates sleepy faces on a Thursday morning. At the front of the classroom, a lecturer gives a lesson about politics, history and geography while the students scribble notes with one hand and sip coffee with the other.</p>

        <p>Every weekday, morning warriors struggle to keep their eyes open in classrooms across campus, but these students are decked head to toe in digitized desert camouflage uniforms.</p>

        <p>The students, who serve as army cadets in the UCLA Reserve Officer Training Corps, trade in their mornings and weekends for scholarships and the opportunity to commission as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces after graduation.</p>

        <p>The U.S. Armed Forces recruit heavily from the Reserve Officer Training Corps. Graduates from the program currently make up one-third of the U.S. Army's officer population.</p>

        <h2 id="title">Day 1</h2>

        <p>A week later, the students piled onto a chartered bus in the faint morning light and headed 100 miles south to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, located along the craggy Pacific coast in San Diego County.</p>

        <p>They pulled up in a cloud of dust a few hours later, greeted by the Leadership Reaction Course – a mix of wooden pallets, spent ammunition canisters and bulky metal barrels.</p>

        <p>The course, structured to simulate combat situations, consists of 10 stations, each designed to test soldiers’ leadership, teamwork and creativity with a series of puzzle-like challenges.</p>

        <p>At one training station, a bridge was broken down to its foundations and the cadets were tasked with navigating to the other side using three wooden planks. In another, they had to bring a stretcher and dummy through a plastic tunnel about four feet in diameter.</p>

        <p>After surveying the course, Maya Pathuri, a first-year chemistry student at UCLA, said she was excited to apply the skills the cadets had learned.</p>

        <p>Her beaming smile turned to teeth-grit determination as she struggled to climb up a wall only to slide back down, again and again. She followed every failed attempt with a set of push-ups, until she finally made it over with a helping hand.</p>

        <p>"My teammates kept supporting me," Pathuri said. “I threw my weight, trusted my teammates and I made it over. Adrenaline was rushing through me, I was shaking, but was it awesome to know my team was there for me.”</p>

        <div class="pullquote-left">
          <p>"Her beaming smile turned to teeth-grit determination as she struggled to climb up a wall only to slide back down, again and again. She followed every failed attempt with a set of push-ups, until she finally made it over with a helping hand."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Cadets prepare for the intellectual and physical rigors of serving in the army with three days of training a week and one weekly military science lab.</p>

        <p>Every spring, cadets supplement their weekly training with four days at Camp Pendleton, as part of the Leadership Development Exercise that allows cadets to practice the practical applications of small unit tactics, leadership and fieldcraft.</p>

        <p>The Bruin Battalion, a group of ROTC students administered out of UCLA, includes one company headquartered on campus in Westwood and another based out of California State University, Northridge.</p>

        <p>Cadets first practiced the basics of operating out in the field, including the fireman carry used to heave wounded comrades out of combat, before checking out rifles, light machine guns and blank ammunition for combat simulations.</p>

        <p>Over the next few days, the trainees would get to know their guns intimately, slinging them across their shoulders on marches, taking them along on bathroom trips and tucking them into their sleeping bags at night. Cadets are instructed to keep their weapons within an arm’s length at all times.</p>

        <p>Patrick Manrique, a cadet captain and fourth-year deaf studies student at CSUN , made it his job to collect misplaced rifles like Halloween candy.</p>

        <p>“Here you’re not going to get shot, but over there, it’s life and death," Manrique said.</p>

        <p>Once the cadets were geared up, they split into two platoons and embarked on a tactical march to their patrol bases, where they would sleep for the night before undertaking a mission the next day.</p>

        <p>At all times, at least a third of the soldiers are required to keep watch, or pull security, at the base perimeter with their weapons, while commanders plan the next day’s mission. Cadets secure the patrol base in a triangle formation with light machine guns placed at the corners. The cadets sleep in shifts, shoving their buddies awake before they’re screamed at by their commanding officers.</p>

        <h2 id="title">Day 2</h2>

        <p>The platoon rose dark and early at 0430 hours with groans, coughs and the occasional flash of a red-beam headlamp.</p>


        <p>Linnea Earl-Gore, assigned platoon leader and a third-year kinesiology student at CSUN, packed up her rucksack and makes the final preparation for this morning’s mission – investigating sightings of enemy forces and disrupting their supply lines.</p>

        <p>The period right before dawn breaks is historically when bases are most frequently attacked and overrun. In order to guard against this, the cadets were at "stand to," pulling 100 percent security at the edge of their camp.</p>

        <p>A car sped by on a nearby road blaring Guns N’ Roses’ “Sweet Child O’ Mine” out of its speakers, taking cadets' attention away from the simulation for a brief moment.</p>

        <p>Kyle Johnson, a fourth-year international studies student at Pepperdine University charged with evaluating the students, stands watching the cadets and taking notes every so often on prepared scorecards.</p>

        <p>“We do not expect the cadets to be tactical experts by any means," Johnson said. "We want to see how they can control and manage their people in evolving and adapting situations.”</p>

        <p>"Evolving situations" was code for an ambush. About 15 minutes into the march, the harsh clatter of gunfire emerged from the tree line.</p>

        <p>The cadets dropped to the ground and hesitated, taken by surprise, before their training and adrenaline kicked in. They fired back, ditching their weighty rucksacks and shouting out the position and status of the enemy. A squad of cadets flanked to take them out from the side.</p>

        <div class="pullquote-right">
          <p>"About 15 minutes into the march, the harsh clatter of gunfire emerged from the tree line. The cadets dropped to the ground and hesitated, taken by surprise, before their training and adrenaline kicked in."</p>
        </div>

        <p>After eliminating the threat, cadets searched the enemy for intelligence and weapons before making a radio call to report the casualties.</p>

        <p>Nicole Tom, an air force cadet who volunteered to act as the opposition force, lay still on the ground at the end of the battle.</p>

        <p>“It was a slow start, but they figured it out pretty quickly,” said Tom, a fourth-year Russian studies student at UCLA. “It was pretty tough terrain to work in.”</p>

        <p>After the mission is completed, a new platoon leader was assigned the next mission. In the lull, cadets lunched on Meals Ready to Eat, an army ration that contains a selection of food of varying edibility.</p>

        <p>An hour and a steep hike later, cadets spotted the objective of the mission – a weapons cache. They marched toward it, their boots crunching the tall grass until a sharp whistle is heard from behind.</p>

        <p>Then, boom.</p>

        <p>The cadets dropped to the dirt, before getting up to sprint and shout orders, as one of the UCLA ROTC staff sergeants let loose with simulated artillery rounds.</p>

        <p>A squad set out to investigate the weapons cache, battling enemy they encountered along the way.</p>

        <p>After the platoons completed their missions, they met up and made camp, with one group choosing a location under the shade of a massive tree.</p>

        <p>As darkness fell, the assigned platoon leader, Jose “Pepe” Avellaneda, a third-year physiological science student at UCLA, was wary of the possibility of a surprise attack and called for everyone available to guard the patrol base.</p>

        <p>The cadets then settled in for a long night of pulling security. Moonlight streamed through the branches of the tree overhead, as cadets squinted at mysterious lights that flicker on and off in the distance.</p>

        <h2 id="title">Day 3</h2>

        <p>“Contact!”</p>

        <p>A few hours later, the sound of gunfire erupted from the patrol base as smoke and explosions boomed in the dark.</p>

        <p>Avellaneda mustered his troops to the challenge, shouting commands over the din of battle. After about 15 minutes, the attack subsided as a cry of "cease-fire" echoed across the patrol bases.</p>

        <p>The cadets relaxed and their battle stations transformed back into backpacks and sleeping bags as they tried to catch some sleep before the end of the night.</p>

        <p>In the morning, their mission seemed simple – go into a nearby village, build rapport with the locals and gather information on a high-value target called “the doughnut man.”</p>

        <p>But the path into the village was paved with explosives instructors hid on the road. Cadets tripped the devices, leading to the nominal death of a good portion of the group along with a noisy lecture by the trainers.</p>

        <p>“Look around," yelled Sgt. First Class August Maggio. "Stop thinking about tomorrow, next week – you’re right here now. You train like you fight."</p>

        <p>With their heads on a swivel, the cadets made their way up to the castle where they were to meet a village police chief.</p>

        <p>Older cadets developed the "key leader engagement" exercise from their own training in Fort Knox, Kentucky, over the summer, to introduce newer cadets to the concept, said cadet captain Matthew Li, a fourth-year engineering geology student at UCLA who was in charge of formulating the scenario.</p>

        <div class="pullquote-left">
          <p>"Stop thinking about tomorrow, next week – you’re right here now. You train like you fight."</p><p><cite>Sgt. First Class August Maggio</cite>
        </div>

        <p>The increased emphasis on building relationships reflects a larger strategic shift in the Army against agressive action, Li said. The so-called “hearts and minds” effort aims to win over the trust of the local population.</p>

        <p>“It’s not just the important people that matter, it's also about the smaller people – the average Joes in the squad,” Li said. “You’ve really got to be conscientious about how they're doing and what they're doing once they get into the village.”</p>

        <p>In the village, a number of volunteers from UCLA ROTC played a litany of different roles, ranging from an irate village shopkeeper to a town vagrant with a penchant for trading secrets for snacks.</p>

        <p>Under a tented area, the platoon leader met with the police chief, trying to downplay issues with their first meeting the day before, until an outside attack eventually lead to the soldiers evacuating the town and ending the mission.</p>

        <p>To further emphasize teamwork, cadets were assigned a companywide mission that includes both platoons. In order to capture the target, the company was tasked with raiding a town to capture or kill the enemy leader.</p>

        <p>Behind the cover of multicolored smoke grenades, soldiers flooded into the town like lines of helmeted ants, with legs and adrenaline pumping. They split up into squads, evacuating civilians, breaching buildings and eliminating opposing forces with gunfire.</p>

        <div class="pullquote-right">

        </div>

        <p>At the far end of the village, the cadets pulled out the struggling target, wrestling him to the ground and zip-tying his hands behind his back. After confirming his identity, the cadets hoofed it out of the village as fast as they could, dragging the wounded and dodging ear-splitting blasts from simulated artillery rounds.</p>

        <p>“The more you engage yourself in these training exercises, the more ready you are when faced with the real thing,” said cadet captain Timu Saari, a fourth-year biology student at UCLA. “We talk a lot about violence of action – you need to do these tasks with vigor and with violent intent. It’s a state of mind.”</p>

        <p>Instructors then reviewed the operational details and lessons learned from the training exercises in an after-action report, and cadets made their way back to camp where they were welcomed with a non-MRE dinner of chicken and mashed potatoes.</p>

        <p>A hot meal and a few equipment checks later, the cadets finished the day by cleaning their guns with Q-tips, solutions and brushes. They laid their weapons out on their ponchos, the monotonous hum of a generator providing a fitting score to the hours of meticulous polishing ahead.</p>

        <h2 id="title">Day 4</h2>

        <p>The next morning held the promise of a return to civilization, after a long weekend of training in the field. The drive back was uneventful, with an occasional snore interrupting the rhythm of the bumpy road.</p>

        <p>Upon their return to campus, the uniformed cadets provided a striking contrast against the civilians taking in the sun on Sunday morning.</p>

        <p>But come Monday, the cadets would return to their roles as students, equipped with with midterms, papers and packed class schedules instead of rucksacks and rifles.</p>

        <p>One dirt-caked cadet joked about making a patrol base in his dorm room and the rest laughed, more out of exhaustion than anything else.</p>

        <p>“The sooner we get this stuff packed up and moved, the sooner we can get you out of here and back home,” Saari said.</p>

        <p>“Hooah,” the cadets answered in unison.</p>

              <h2>Sean Andrews</h2>
              <h4>WRITTEN BY Kevin Truong <br/>// PHOTOS BY Kathy Chen</h4>

              <p>Sean Andrews attended a stress prevention course on his first day of training.<br /><br />

              On day two, he took a suicide prevention class, complete with lurid pictures to drive the point home, and day three was even more grisly.<br /><br />

              The second-year Cal State Northridge history student found himself standing on the sterile linoleum floor of the city morgue in Richmond, Virginia, alongside other trainees.<br /><br />

              He remembers it was dead silent.<br /><br />

              They were staring at what was left of a person burned beyond recognition, skeletal remains and a torso with a bit of flesh still left clinging to the bones.<br /><br />

              After the initial shock, the next patient rolled in – an 80-year-old man who died of a heart attack alone in his home and laid there decomposing for weeks before anyone discovered him.<br /><br />

              What Andrews remembers was the smell, and even now he finds it hard to describe. The closest he can get is rotting meat, covered with old curdled milk and a dozen spoiled eggs cracked atop. The smell of death.<br /><br />

              Evolutionary speaking, the smell serves a purpose, sending a putrid message for everyone to steer clear as the person makes their journey into the afterlife.<br /><br />

              But in his line of work, Andrews wasn’t given that luxury. As a mortuary affairs specialist in the United States Army, his job is to deal with all deceased soldiers and civilian personnel. That includes operations like search and recovery, processing, embalming and assisting with autopsies.<br /><br />

              “After a while you get used to the shock of seeing human remains, but seeing human remains with uniforms on still gets to you,” he said.<br /><br />

              He saw himself in the people laid out in front of him and it made him question his own mortality.<br /><br />

              This job wasn’t his first choice, but it was what he needed to do to join the military.<br /><br />

              “The only reason I went (into) mortuary affairs is because it was the only option afforded to me at the time,” he said. “It sounded horrifying, but I wanted to be in the army more than I cared about what I did in the army.”<br /><br />

              So he endured the next eight weeks of training, relying on his team members and professional counseling to push him past the finish line.<br /><br />

              Completing his training was hard, but Andrews said returning to civilian life as a college student was even harder.<br /><br />
              He found himself thinking of human beings as patients rather than people. It took him a while to get over it. Now, he spends his free time training with his national guard unit to stay connected to a military lifestyle that has become second nature.<br /><br />

              Andrews said he’s thankful for his experience in mortuary affairs. It’s given him perspective, if not a darker sense of humor.<br /><br />

              “Overall, I think it’s made me a better person,” Andrews said with a chuckle. “If you can handle stress like that, what are midterms?”</p>

              <h2>Jose 'Pepe' Avellaneda</h2>
              <h4>WRITTEN BY Kevin Truong <br />// PHOTOS BY Kathy Chen</h4>

              <p>During their third year, ROTC cadets are constantly evaluated and ranked to determine their strengths and leadership styles.<br /><br />

              Jose "Pepe" Avellaneda was labeled “the motivator,” a fitting title for the third-year physiological science student. But it was something he seldom had the privilege of experiencing growing up.<br /><br />

              One of his earliest memories is sitting in class listening to his teacher Ms. Meijia read “The Giving Tree,” by Shel Silverstein. At the end, she was in tears.<br /><br />

              Then 7-year-old Pepe hazarded a hand up in the air and asked why she was crying.<br /><br />

              “You kids don’t know what your parents do for you,” his teacher replied.<br /><br />

              The message stuck in his brain as he watched his single mother rush from job to job to support their family.<br /><br />

              “I learned pretty early to embrace the suck – life isn’t always perfect,” Avellaneda said. “But like my mom always said, ‘It could be worse. We could be homeless, we could not have a roof over our heads.'”<br /><br />

              For a while, his family was stable, and Avellaneda had a role model – a stepfather who he said taught him the most important lessons about perseverance and faith that kept him going through tough times. But his parents split up after a few years, and they lost their home when he was a sophomore in high school.<br /><br />

              “Still she said ‘It could be worse, it could be worse,’” Avellaneda said about his mother. “And I was like ‘Mom, I don’t know about that, my life kind of just crumbled away.’”<br /><br />

              They moved in with his grandparents, until his mother found a new boyfriend and told him she wanted to relocate the family to Oklahoma.<br /><br />

              “I said ‘No mama, I choose education,’” Avellaneda said. “It was the first time I really disagreed with what my mom thought I should do. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.”<br /><br />

              So his mother moved, leaving Avellaneda and his sister behind in California. Later, his sister left his grandmother’s house to join his mom in the Midwest, and still Avellaneda attempted to stay positive.<br /><br />

              “So my sister’s gone, my mom’s gone, my dad’s gone,” Avellaneda said. “But I still tried (to think) ‘Hey, it could be worse.’”<br /><br />

              Soon after his family left, he got into an argument with one of his uncles and his grandmother asked him to move out.<br /><br />

              It was early on a spring Saturday morning , and he was still in high school. He left his things in storage and crashed on friends’ couches, park benches and in Starbucks coffee shops. It became harder and harder to keep saying that things could be worse.<br /><br />

              Avellaneda spoke to his stepfather at what he considers his lowest point, and was told to put his trust in God. Soon afterward, he was hired at McDonald's, a job that allowed him to save enough money to pay rent for a small apartment.<br /><br />

              But again, his life changed. His mother came back to California seven months pregnant, alone and unable to work. He opened up his tiny home to her and later to his newborn brother Victor, whom he raised like his own son.<br /><br />

              On Victor’s first Christmas, Avellaneda saw his mother sitting at the foot of his bed. She said she was scared, so he asked what was wrong.<br /><br />

              She told him she had been diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />

              "I was like ‘Ma, it’s Christmas, why right now? Don’t tell me right now, you should have told me another day,’” Avellaneda said, tears building up in his eyes.<br /><br />

              He said he still hasn’t asked all the details about his mother’s condition. He doesn’t really want to know.<br /><br />

              Despite the turmoil in his life, Avellaneda still tried to focus on earning good grades and applying to colleges. While he worked the fry station at the Golden Arches, a notification popped up on his cell phone. It was an email from UCLA informing him of his admission status.<br /><br />

              He held off on opening the email for the six hours left in his shift , and he held off during the 3-mile walk home. He wanted his mom to be there. With a deep breath and his mother at his side, he turned on his laptop and clicked.<br /><br />

              He saw the word “congratulations” and didn’t read anything else. Couldn’t. He was crying too hard.<br /><br />

              “Ever since my parents’ divorce that was my first break, that was my first break in life,” Avellaneda said. “Like not that life could be worse, like, ‘It’s good?’”<br /><br />

              He now dreams of becoming a doctor, going to medical school and entering the military medical corps. He said he wants to help people and share what he can with the rest of the world.<br /><br />

              On Saturday evening, with four days of stink and sweat baked into his uniform, he polishes a blackened bolt from his M4 rifle at the front end of a six-hour gun cleaning session. He smiles and shrugs.<br /><br />

              “It could be worse,” he said.</p>

              <h2>Louis Bethge</h2>
              <h4>WRITTEN BY Kevin Truong <br />// PHOTOS BY Kathy Chen</h4>

              <p>Louis Bethge is a big dude.<br /><br />

              At 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, Bethge leaves size 13 boot prints in the dirt with a 27-pound M249 light machine gun slung across his back like a lunch box.<br /><br />

              The second-year Russian studies student has eluded enemy forces over the horizon and defenders barreling toward him in the hockey rink, but an envelope delivered to him on Dec. 4 during his senior year in high school hit him hard.<br /><br />

              Inside was a formally worded letter from Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board that informed Bethge he was rejected from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, because of a medical condition. He felt blindsided.<br /><br />

              “Flaming” is the word he used to describe his emotional state, but “pissed off” might be the more accurate term. He still has to pause to calm himself before he talks about it.<br /><br />

              The entire year prior – writing essays, performing physical fitness tests and collecting congressional nominations – was worth nothing. Still, as any good soldier should, he carried on.<br /><br />

              Bethge gave up on his dream of going to the Naval Academy and turned his attention to applying for the Air Force and Army ROTC scholarships. A few months later, he received a letter informing him he had earned the Air Force scholarship.<br /><br />

              But another letter came a few days later, and again he was ruled out for medical reasons. This time, “flaming” was replaced by something not fit to print.<br /><br />

              Bethge, an out-of-state student, could not attend UCLA without financial aid from the scholarship. His Army application rendered the same result, but gave him a small window of possibility for a scholarship if he sent in more medical information.<br /><br />

              So he submitted a medical waiver request, which was denied. And then another, which was met with resounding silence.<br /><br />

              At the time, he thought back to when he was 13, on vacation off the coast of South Carolina with his family – when he tried to run after his brother on the beach and physically couldn’t.<br /><br />

              His mind flashes forward a couple days, when he was being wheeled into the operating room after being diagnosed with a disease with an unknown origin and too long of a name.<br /><br />

              But this was four years later and he had to choose a college, so he broke the rules and enrolled at both the University of Maryland and UCLA , crossing his fingers and waiting for a call that didn’t come.<br /><br />

              He moved into his dorm room in College Park, Maryland, and met his roommates. He started his classes, and was assigned a group project due the next week. Then his phone finally rang, two and a half weeks after his first day of school.<br /><br />

              One day later, he unenrolled from Maryland. Two days later, he packed his things. Three days later, he boarded a cross-country flight to the West Coast, bound for the UCLA ROTC program.<br /><br />

              “A lot of things people see as huge deals, they just aren’t,” he said. “Everything works out in the end as long as you keep working, you keep driving. And that’s what I take to heart.”</p>

              <h2>Joshua Glenn</h2>
              <h4>WRITTEN BY Kevin Truong<br />// PHOTOS BY Kathy Chen</h4>

              <p>Joshua Glenn tends to slink away from praise, but the first-year mathematics student at The Master's College in Santa Clarita, California, has worn quite a few hats in his life.<br /><br />

              The champion gymnast. The West Point cadet. The ROTC student.<br /><br />

              He completes goals for himself, not for the recognition, but for the competition and excellence that comes from being elite. It was why he liked gymnastics, and it’s why he likes the military.<br /><br />

              Even so, Glenn said he never really felt comfortable with the applause that follows a perfectly executed floor routine. He was happier about the four-hour-per-day practices that got him there.<br /><br />

              And he didn’t really like the praise that came with being accepted to West Point. Instead, he preferred conducting the field exercises he needed to become an infantry officer.<br /><br />

              He hated the claps on the back, the sympathy and the obligatory encouragement – when he broke his ankle so badly during a training exercise it almost needed to be amputated, and again when he had to leave West Point and the army with an honorable discharge.<br /><br />

              Even when the colonel pinned a medal on his chest for perseverance, he felt it was an award he didn’t deserve.<br /><br />

              Glenn said he has a hard time feeling proud of himself, but he has no trouble being proud of someone else – his little brother, Jesse, who graduates from West Point at the end of this semester.<br /><br />

              He can’t help but smile when he talks about how close they are, their weekly catch-up video chats and their dream of serving in the same unit.<br /><br />

              When asked what advice he would give his younger brother, he thinks for a minute and repeats a motto that has carried him through both triumphs and tough times.<br /><br />

              “Strive for excellence in whatever you do.”</p>

              <h2>Michelle Suh</h2>
              <h4>WRITTEN BY Kevin Truong <br />// PHOTOS BY Kathy Chen</h4>
              <p>As she walks to class, Michelle Suh often listens to a song called "Gabriel’s Oboe."<br /><br />

              It comes from the 1986 film “The Mission,” about a Spanish priest who is thrust into a strange land halfway around the world, where his faith is tested among foreigners. For Suh, a fourth-year psychology student, the story is a familiar one.<br /><br />

              Maybe hers is familiar too. The one about a girl who left her home in South Korea and everyone she’s ever known at the age of 12. The girl who moved to a small town called Winona Lake, Indiana, as the only Asian student in her seventh grade class. The girl who cried every day for the first month in a new house with a host family she had never met.<br /><br />

              Maybe you know what came next. She used sports and music to communicate with others. She turned to her faith for strength to deal with the constant moving, with always meeting new people, with the instability. She resented her heritage because it was the one thing that made her irreparably different from her peers and classmates.<br /><br />

              Maybe you know the rest. The girl was shocked by the cursing, the partying and the drinking at UCLA. She joined ROTC, quit and rejoined, and realized the freedom to practice her own beliefs meant allowing others to do the same.<br /><br />

              And maybe you guessed how the story ends. She realized God’s plan for her was to become an Army chaplain. She found interests in healing and helping others both physically and spiritually.<br /><br />

              The story about the girl who found a purpose, a new home and a happy ending.</p>
