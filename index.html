        <p>A slide depicting a map of an arid desert region illuminates sleepy faces on a Thursday morning. At the front of the classroom, a lecturer gives a lesson about politics, history and geography while the students scribble notes with one hand and sip coffee with the other.</p>

        <p>Every weekday, morning warriors struggle to keep their eyes open in classrooms across campus, but these students are decked head to toe in digitized desert camouflage uniforms.</p>

        <p>The students, who serve as army cadets in the UCLA Reserve Officer Training Corps, trade in their mornings and weekends for scholarships and the opportunity to commission as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces after graduation.</p>

        <p>The U.S. Armed Forces recruit heavily from the Reserve Officer Training Corps. Graduates from the program currently make up one-third of the U.S. Army's officer population.</p>

        <img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/04/web.news_.rotc_.1.KC_.jpg">

        <h2>Day 1</h2>

        <p>A week later, the students piled onto a chartered bus in the faint morning light and headed 100 miles south to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, located along the craggy Pacific coast in San Diego County.</p>

        <p>They pulled up in a cloud of dust a few hours later, greeted by the Leadership Reaction Course – a mix of wooden pallets, spent ammunition canisters and bulky metal barrels.</p>

        <p>The course, structured to simulate combat situations, consists of 10 stations, each designed to test soldiers’ leadership, teamwork and creativity with a series of puzzle-like challenges.</p>

        <p>At one training station, a bridge was broken down to its foundations and the cadets were tasked with navigating to the other side using three wooden planks. In another, they had to bring a stretcher and dummy through a plastic tunnel about four feet in diameter.</p>

        <p>After surveying the course, Maya Pathuri, a first-year chemistry student at UCLA, said she was excited to apply the skills the cadets had learned.</p>

        <p>Her beaming smile turned to teeth-grit determination as she struggled to climb up a wall only to slide back down, again and again. She followed every failed attempt with a set of push-ups, until she finally made it over with a helping hand.</p>

        <p>"My teammates kept supporting me," Pathuri said. “I threw my weight, trusted my teammates and I made it over. Adrenaline was rushing through me, I was shaking, but was it awesome to know my team was there for me.”</p>

        <p>Cadets prepare for the intellectual and physical rigors of serving in the army with three days of training a week and one weekly military science lab.</p>

        <p>Every spring, cadets supplement their weekly training with four days at Camp Pendleton, as part of the Leadership Development Exercise that allows cadets to practice the practical applications of small unit tactics, leadership and fieldcraft.</p>

        <p>The Bruin Battalion, a group of ROTC students administered out of UCLA, includes one company headquartered on campus in Westwood and another based out of California State University, Northridge.</p>

        <p>Cadets first practiced the basics of operating out in the field, including the fireman carry used to heave wounded comrades out of combat, before checking out rifles, light machine guns and blank ammunition for combat simulations.</p>

        <p>Over the next few days, the trainees would get to know their guns intimately, slinging them across their shoulders on marches, taking them along on bathroom trips and tucking them into their sleeping bags at night. Cadets are instructed to keep their weapons within an arm’s length at all times.</p>

        <p>Patrick Manrique, a cadet captain and fourth-year deaf studies student at CSUN , made it his job to collect misplaced rifles like Halloween candy.</p>

        <p>“Here you’re not going to get shot, but over there, it’s life and death," Manrique said.</p>

        <p>Once the cadets were geared up, they split into two platoons and embarked on a tactical march to their patrol bases, where they would sleep for the night before undertaking a mission the next day.</p>

        <p>At all times, at least a third of the soldiers are required to keep watch, or pull security, at the base perimeter with their weapons, while commanders plan the next day’s mission. Cadets secure the patrol base in a triangle formation with light machine guns placed at the corners. The cadets sleep in shifts, shoving their buddies awake before they’re screamed at by their commanding officers.</p>

        <img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/04/web.news_.rotc_.2.KC_.jpg">

        <h2>Day 2</h2>

        <p>The platoon rose dark and early at 0430 hours with groans, coughs and the occasional flash of a red-beam headlamp.</p>


        <p>Linnea Earl-Gore, assigned platoon leader and a third-year kinesiology student at CSUN, packed up her rucksack and makes the final preparation for this morning’s mission – investigating sightings of enemy forces and disrupting their supply lines.</p>

        <p>The period right before dawn breaks is historically when bases are most frequently attacked and overrun. In order to guard against this, the cadets were at "stand to," pulling 100 percent security at the edge of their camp.</p>

        <p>A car sped by on a nearby road blaring Guns N’ Roses’ “Sweet Child O’ Mine” out of its speakers, taking cadets' attention away from the simulation for a brief moment.</p>

        <p>Kyle Johnson, a fourth-year international studies student at Pepperdine University charged with evaluating the students, stands watching the cadets and taking notes every so often on prepared scorecards.</p>

        <p>“We do not expect the cadets to be tactical experts by any means," Johnson said. "We want to see how they can control and manage their people in evolving and adapting situations.”</p>

        <p>"Evolving situations" was code for an ambush. About 15 minutes into the march, the harsh clatter of gunfire emerged from the tree line.</p>

        <p>The cadets dropped to the ground and hesitated, taken by surprise, before their training and adrenaline kicked in. They fired back, ditching their weighty rucksacks and shouting out the position and status of the enemy. A squad of cadets flanked to take them out from the side.</p>

        <p>After eliminating the threat, cadets searched the enemy for intelligence and weapons before making a radio call to report the casualties.</p>

        <p>Nicole Tom, an air force cadet who volunteered to act as the opposition force, lay still on the ground at the end of the battle.</p>

        <p>“It was a slow start, but they figured it out pretty quickly,” said Tom, a fourth-year Russian studies student at UCLA. “It was pretty tough terrain to work in.”</p>

        <p>After the mission is completed, a new platoon leader was assigned the next mission. In the lull, cadets lunched on Meals Ready to Eat, an army ration that contains a selection of food of varying edibility.</p>

        <p>An hour and a steep hike later, cadets spotted the objective of the mission – a weapons cache. They marched toward it, their boots crunching the tall grass until a sharp whistle is heard from behind.</p>

        <p>Then, boom.</p>

        <p>The cadets dropped to the dirt, before getting up to sprint and shout orders, as one of the UCLA ROTC staff sergeants let loose with simulated artillery rounds.</p>

        <p>A squad set out to investigate the weapons cache, battling enemy they encountered along the way.</p>

        <p>After the platoons completed their missions, they met up and made camp, with one group choosing a location under the shade of a massive tree.</p>

        <p>As darkness fell, the assigned platoon leader, Jose “Pepe” Avellaneda, a third-year physiological science student at UCLA, was wary of the possibility of a surprise attack and called for everyone available to guard the patrol base.</p>

        <p>The cadets then settled in for a long night of pulling security. Moonlight streamed through the branches of the tree overhead, as cadets squinted at mysterious lights that flicker on and off in the distance.</p>

        <img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/04/web.news_.rotc_.28.KC_.jpg">

        <h2>Day 3</h2>

        <p>“Contact!”</p>

        <p>A few hours later, the sound of gunfire erupted from the patrol base as smoke and explosions boomed in the dark.</p>

        <p>Avellaneda mustered his troops to the challenge, shouting commands over the din of battle. After about 15 minutes, the attack subsided as a cry of "cease-fire" echoed across the patrol bases.</p>

        <p>The cadets relaxed and their battle stations transformed back into backpacks and sleeping bags as they tried to catch some sleep before the end of the night.</p>

        <p>In the morning, their mission seemed simple – go into a nearby village, build rapport with the locals and gather information on a high-value target called “the doughnut man.”</p>

        <p>But the path into the village was paved with explosives instructors hid on the road. Cadets tripped the devices, leading to the nominal death of a good portion of the group along with a noisy lecture by the trainers.</p>

        <p>“Look around," yelled Sgt. First Class August Maggio. "Stop thinking about tomorrow, next week – you’re right here now. You train like you fight."</p>

        <p>With their heads on a swivel, the cadets made their way up to the castle where they were to meet a village police chief.</p>

        <p>Older cadets developed the "key leader engagement" exercise from their own training in Fort Knox, Kentucky, over the summer, to introduce newer cadets to the concept, said cadet captain Matthew Li, a fourth-year engineering geology student at UCLA who was in charge of formulating the scenario.</p>

        <p>The increased emphasis on building relationships reflects a larger strategic shift in the Army against agressive action, Li said. The so-called “hearts and minds” effort aims to win over the trust of the local population.</p>

        <p>“It’s not just the important people that matter, it's also about the smaller people – the average Joes in the squad,” Li said. “You’ve really got to be conscientious about how they're doing and what they're doing once they get into the village.”</p>

        <p>In the village, a number of volunteers from UCLA ROTC played a litany of different roles, ranging from an irate village shopkeeper to a town vagrant with a penchant for trading secrets for snacks.</p>

        <p>Under a tented area, the platoon leader met with the police chief, trying to downplay issues with their first meeting the day before, until an outside attack eventually lead to the soldiers evacuating the town and ending the mission.</p>

        <p>To further emphasize teamwork, cadets were assigned a companywide mission that includes both platoons. In order to capture the target, the company was tasked with raiding a town to capture or kill the enemy leader.</p>

        <p>Behind the cover of multicolored smoke grenades, soldiers flooded into the town like lines of helmeted ants, with legs and adrenaline pumping. They split up into squads, evacuating civilians, breaching buildings and eliminating opposing forces with gunfire.</p>

        <p>At the far end of the village, the cadets pulled out the struggling target, wrestling him to the ground and zip-tying his hands behind his back. After confirming his identity, the cadets hoofed it out of the village as fast as they could, dragging the wounded and dodging ear-splitting blasts from simulated artillery rounds.</p>

        <p>“The more you engage yourself in these training exercises, the more ready you are when faced with the real thing,” said cadet captain Timu Saari, a fourth-year biology student at UCLA. “We talk a lot about violence of action – you need to do these tasks with vigor and with violent intent. It’s a state of mind.”</p>

        <p>Instructors then reviewed the operational details and lessons learned from the training exercises in an after-action report, and cadets made their way back to camp where they were welcomed with a non-MRE dinner of chicken and mashed potatoes.</p>

        <p>A hot meal and a few equipment checks later, the cadets finished the day by cleaning their guns with Q-tips, solutions and brushes. They laid their weapons out on their ponchos, the monotonous hum of a generator providing a fitting score to the hours of meticulous polishing ahead.</p>

        <img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/04/web.news_.rotc_.20.KC_.jpg">

        <h2>Day 4</h2>

        <p>The next morning held the promise of a return to civilization, after a long weekend of training in the field. The drive back was uneventful, with an occasional snore interrupting the rhythm of the bumpy road.</p>

        <p>Upon their return to campus, the uniformed cadets provided a striking contrast against the civilians taking in the sun on Sunday morning.</p>

        <p>But come Monday, the cadets would return to their roles as students, equipped with with midterms, papers and packed class schedules instead of rucksacks and rifles.</p>

        <p>One dirt-caked cadet joked about making a patrol base in his dorm room and the rest laughed, more out of exhaustion than anything else.</p>

        <p>“The sooner we get this stuff packed up and moved, the sooner we can get you out of here and back home,” Saari said.</p>

        <p>“Hooah,” the cadets answered in unison.</p>

        <p>14 APR 2016</p>

        <p>So it’s April 14, 6:34 a.m., and we’re at UCLA Wilson Plaza and we’re just waiting to board the bus. Probably gonna be getting on in about 25 minutes. I took one last shower this morning, just to savor it before four days of no washing. [LAUGHS] Which is why baby wipes are gonna be the best. We’re just, we’re waiting.</p>

        <p>I was so excited I actually couldn’t get a whole lot of sleep last night. (Cadet Garcia: Hi, Cadet McDermott.) Hi, Garcia. This is my buddy Garcia. He’s in my squad. (Cadet Garcia: I’m not in his squad.) Yes you are! [LAUGHS]</p>

        <p>Once we get on the bus I’ll probably enter my next log, once we start unpacking and whatnot. So yep, first log. [WHISPERS] Go Bruins.</p>

        <p>--</p>

        <p>Testing, testing. Okay so it’s April 14, Thursday, it’s 12:37. We just finished up some training at the Battle of Fallujah Training Course. It was pretty cool actually. I had a pretty interesting time. My squad and I did pretty well at all four of the stations we were at. I feel like that this is a good start to another four days worth of training.</p>

        <p>We’re right now on a lunch break and I had my first MRE, which was really good actually, surprisingly. I heard a lot of bad things about the one that I had but it tasted pretty good. I’m feeling pretty good, I’m feeling ready for what’s coming up next.</p>

        <p>--</p>

        <p>I’m continuing off my last entry, it’s April 14, 4:24. We’ve moved away from the LRC and we are now at a location closer to the mock village that we will be revisiting in the coming days. We have just gone over rifle training, how to carry a rifle, use a rifle, shoot a rifle, the various type of information. We’ve also gone over EPW, which is enemy prisoner of war, and aid and litter.</p>

        <p>Feeling a little hungry. [LAUGHS] But we’re about to have a really good meal. Right now being prepared. After this we’re gonna be rucking to our next location where we’re gonna be setting up a patrol base. I’m feeling good, I’m keeping hydrated and glad to be out here. Until then I will put in this as my third log.</p>

        <p>15 APR 2016</p>

        <p>I have the sniffles. This is log entry number four. Today is Friday, April 15, it’s 5:10. Woke up about 10 minutes ago after getting I think roughly four to five hours of sleep last night. So I’m feeling a little tired, not gonna lie. I also pulled security last night for two-and-a-half hours along with an additional two hours beforehand when we were forming the perimeter.</p>

        <p>I’m feeling a little tired and a little hungry. But I got a couple snacks so I’ll be munching on that. I’m really missing my bed right now, like bigtime. I’m not gonna lie that that sleeping bag was not very comfortable and we slept on a hill, which sucked. [LAUGHS] But nonetheless I’m still having a good time, it’s a good experience and I’m really up for more. So until then, goodbye.</p>

        <p>--</p>

        <p>Today is April, Friday the fifteenth, it’s 12:45. We’ve just conducted, or we finished conducting a mission where we interrupted a SAAPA resupplying route. That was a pretty cool experience, we got to fire off our rifles at the enemy.</p>

        <p>After conducting the mission and accomplishing the mission, we have come to a new patrol base. To the west of the village that we will be reconning today. We’ll be stepping off at around 2:30 and returning back at 4:30, which is when I’ll probably do my next entry.</p>

        <p>Today is really, really hot and I think I already I have a sunburn on my neck. Definitely missing the A/C in my dorm and my bed and a shower. But hopefully the next couple days go smoothly, just as they’ve already been coming along.</p>

        <p>17 APR 2016</p>

        <p>Today is April 17, Sunday, it’s 7:30 and we’re all gathering up to prepare departure from the LDX location. My thoughts on the other night, the reason I couldn’t put a whole lot of entries is back to back to back we were on the field doing mission after mission after mission. I think yesterday was definitely a good experience as I was involved with all the missions that we conducted. On top of it, when we came back we did weapons maintenance and cleaning which unfortunately took a very long time. It looks like we’re getting ready to do a police call. This is my last entry. I had a really great experience.</p>

    <!-- Radio Story: ROTC Diary -->
    <div class="row stories" id="radio_story">
      <div class="main large-8 large-centered columns">

        <iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/259964363&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

        <p>Refer: ROTC cadets from schools across Southern California, including UCLA, completed a four-day Leadership Development Exercise at the Marine Corps Base in Camp Pendleton earlier this April. Apart from being assessed on how well they executed military tactics and displayed physical endurance, the Bruin Battalion was also evaluated on how well they utilized their interpersonal skills and showed empathy as leaders. These future members of the United States Army are actively being taught to wield diplomacy with the same skill as an assault rifle.</p>

        <p>TRANSCRIPT:</p>

        <p>ALARKON: What does it mean to be a leader? For the Bruin Battalion, it means taking charge of a situation, even when it’s frighteningly real.</p>

        <p>[ambi: explosion; CDT Tom shrieking at CO Mission I]</p>

        <p>ALARKON: A cadet drops to the ground, clutching her thigh. Thankfully, there’s no blood because she’s only posing as a wounded civilian, while other cadets attempt to get her medical care. [--ambi: aid and litter]</p>

        <p>ALARKON: [ambi: CO Mission I--] Here at Camp Pendleton, ROTC cadets are busy completing missions like this one, where their objective is to find a high value target in a small but hostile town. They’re forced to react in real time both to enemy forces and civilians while tending to injuries and fatalities.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: There’s a lot of role playing and cadets are running high on adrenaline while instructors coolly assess their performance on the side. [--ambi: CO Mission I]</p>

        <p>MAGGIO: From what I saw they did good. It was designed for chaos and chaos is what ensued.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: That’s Sergeant First Class August Maggio.</p>

        <p>MAGGIO: A lot of the cadets stepped up if the leadership failed or wasn’t acting. I think they learned over the past two days what is expected of them because they are gonna be the future leaders of the military. They have to get accustomed to that, not always having it spoonfed to them. Kind of, here’s some info, fill in the blanks, make it happen by this time, period. If they don’t then they’re gonna get the motivation sticks again and we get them moving.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: He’s wearing a tactical vest which carries smoke canisters and a number of what are referred to as "motivation sticks."</p>

        <p>MAGGIO: A motivation stick would either be a grenade simulator or an RE simulator. Just to make them speed up a little bit. Every once in awhile I gotta motivate them up. They like it, no matter how much they think they don’t.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: The success of these missions, according to First Lieutenant Natasha Ikejiri, relies on two key things.</p>

        <p>IKEJIRI: Communication and teamwork. I think a lot of them wanted to do the cool jobs and they neglected their own jobs. It’s kind of a mess but it’s perfect because it’s gonna simulate what it’s actually like in combat.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: It’s the first time many of these cadets have worked together outside of the classroom. Despite the labs they’ve been to, nothing’s a better learning experience than being out in the field. Officer Trainer Mentor Kyle Johnson, a politics student at Pepperdine University, provided some feedback after a platoon of cadets responded poorly to one of many ambushes.</p>

        <p>[CART: Ikejiri yelling "shift and lift"--]</p>

        <p>JOHNSON: They need to figure out how to work with each other more effectively. We’re going through what’s called a battle drill. A battle drill is standard standard throughout the army. This is definitely a learning experience. I can’t hold that against them because it is their first time ever doing this. For some of them it’s their first time holding a weapon.</p>

        <p>[--CART: Ikejiri yelling "shift and lift"]</p>

        <p>---importance of KLEs--</p>

        <p>ALARKON: While there’s a strong focus on military tactics, there’s an even stronger emphasis placed on cadets flexing their diplomatic muscles. They’re given missions in which they have to develop rapport with potentially hostile forces. Officer Trainer Mentor Stephen Ferrer, who studies kinesiology at CSUN, says such forces determine whether cadets achieve their objectives.</p>

        <p>FERRER: The mission of the platoon was to visit the village and conduct a Key Leader Engagement in order for them to gain some information on high value targets that are in the area, and gain information on the infrastructure, the economy--anything this village needs because their mission right now is to win the hearts and minds of their sector, of their area of operation.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: Officer Trainer Mentor Gerardo Lopez, a sociology student at UCLA, says it’s one of the ways the army is becoming more culturally adaptable.</p>

        <p>LOPEZ: We have to be willing to be open to different cultures, different ideas, different perceptions, you know, because we’re in different countries. We come to these countries and we don’t know much.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: Master Sergeant Paul de Lemos elaborates.</p>

        <p>DE LEMOS: That’s why there’s an emphasis on it here with these cadets because they will be platoon leaders. They will be the ones that are making those key leader engagements. They’ll be doing them daily, sometimes twice daily. A simple half hour meeting over some tea and talking a little bit of business with a police chief, that’s a KLE. So that they know that hey, we got your back and you got our back. That’s what it’s all about.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: He says it’s important for cadets to learn a less heavy-handed approach because the future of the army rests with them.</p>

        <p>DE LEMOS: It’s very easy to go in somewhere, cause a lot of damage and leave. But then we don’t really help anything. The only way to make things better in these countries is to go in there, conduct the operations necessary to remove the problem but also empower them by engaging with those leaders and working hand in hand with them to rebuild their country in any way possible.</p>

        <p>--BREAK ACT--</p>

        <p>DE: LEMOS: Whether that means we do operations with them to capture more insurgents or we conduct operations with them to build a well or a school, it’s very vital that we meet with them. It shows the people from those countries that we do care. We’re not just coming in to break stuff and leave.</p>

        <p>--brief profiles--</p>

        <p>ALARKON: What do the future leaders of the United States Army look like? What draws them to this particular kind of public service?</p>

        <p>ALARKON: For Cadet Conor McDonald, who studies political science and Russian studies at UCLA, it was as simple as seeing a UPS guy roll up to his house.</p>

        <p>MCDONALD: Basically when I was a little kid, the UPS truck came and dropped off a package. I was so amazed that this big group of people can work together to create a system that can help everyone as much as the post office does.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: As he lies in the dust, chin anchored against the butt of his assault rifle, he says being in ROTC just feels right.</p>

        <p>MCDONALD: And it always has. I’ve known I’ve wanted to do this since I was a little kid. But honestly, no matter how much you get crapped upon in this program, I enjoy my time here. I feel like I’m doing a public service and it’s a fun one too. I’m great friends with everyone else here.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: Similarly, Cadet Cheryl Zhu, a geography and geospatial information science student at UCLA, was drawn to ROTC for a sense of purpose, and she stayed for the people she met.</p>

        <p>ZHU: They care about each other, they care about me. They help me a lot to get through difficult times and to help me become the person I am today because they encourage me to be better and more confident, and they challenge me.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: On the other hand, Cadet Ashley Fairbanks, a communication studies (student) at UCLA, hopes to take the skills she learns from ROTC and apply it throughout her career in public service.</p>

        <p>FAIRBANKS: One of my main goals after ROTC is either join LAPD or LAFD. After that my goal is to go into politics when I retire. After you’ve been into a soldier’s shoes, or a police officer’s shoes, or a fireman’s shoes, and you’re also an everyday person. You have that ability to grasp with all the knowledge you have and be like okay, this needs to be changed because this isn’t fair to our soldiers, this isn’t fair to our citizens, the shouldn’t be doing this. On the political level, you can make that happen.</p>

        <p>--wrapping up--ambi--</p>

        <p>ALARKON: Observer Trainer Mentor Timu Saari was instrumental in organizing LDX. He says the changes to the ROTC training program are designed to produce a new breed of soldiers.</p>

        <p>SAARI: I think it focuses on a different sort of leader. We’re focused on character, not so much how fast you are or how many pushups can you do. Now those things are important, but there are so many more important things. I hope that these steps, as we go along, just do a better job to bring that sort of leader, who is adaptable, who is capable of relating to such a diverse world that is ever evolving.</p>

        <p>ALARKON: Only time will tell if this shift in focus succeeds an actual conflict zone. For now, the rounds the cadets fire at each other are blank. At the end of each day, opposition forces remove their costumes and become friendly cadets again. Motivation sticks are just motivation sticks, and not life-threatening grenades. And in the morning, when they’re woken up before the sun, they’ll continue their march on the long road ahead.</p>

        <p>--AMBI: boots on grass--</p>

        <p>ALARKON: For the Daily Bruin, I’m Katrina Alarkon.</p>
